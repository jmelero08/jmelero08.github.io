 So this was my first coding project and man, it was intresting. Making a new ruby gem was easy enough thanks to the provided video done by Avi with his daily deals gem, highly recommend. The hard part for me when getting started was first figuring out if I wanted to make my own enviorment or just use the sandbox IDE. I started with the sandbox and that was a mistake. I had nothing but problems when trying to push any edits to GitHub. After awhile I desided to set up my own enviorment on my windows desktop. That wasn't working very well either, so I decided to move everything to my macbook laptop. Once I did that, everything just fell into place. 

Now the fun part, coding. Im a pretty big fan of stand up comedy, so I decided to make a gem that would show the upcoming comedians at either fo the three Wiseguys comedy clubs location in Utah (where I live). Using it is at easy as it sounds, user will choose a location, recieve a list of comedians for that location, then the user can choose a comedian to get more info/biography on that comedian. I had to go back and forth a lot with multiple articles and websites to get my code to work. But eventually I got it. Now its not perfect by anymeans, just like anything else it can be improved. I feel pretty good about how it came out, and im excited on how the next project will go.
