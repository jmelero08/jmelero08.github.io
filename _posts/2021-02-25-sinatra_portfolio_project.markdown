So when I got to my sinatra project, I had a hard time coming up with an idea on what to base my app on. Then my significate other, suggested that I should make an app that can be used to track your workouts. I thought that it was a great idea and go started. I used the corneal gem to get everything started and that was a life saver. For those who don't know, the corneal gem will make all the folders that you would need in order to at least get started on your app. From there I decided I would only have two models,  a user model, and a workout entry model. I figured I would need anything else and this just made things really simple. 

From there I got started on making the user controller, and view pages. The view pages consisted of the login, signup, and show page. After that I did pretty much the same thing with the workout entry controller. There was only one issue that I had when doing the project. I had an issue with the password not being hidden in the web browser, even though it was being encrypted in the data base. For the life of me I couldn't figure it out, untill I reached out to Dustin, one of the leads, and he helped me out. Of course it was something really small and kind of dumb that I was overlooking, but I spent way to much time to figure it out. Anyway, Thanks Dustin!

After that, everything came together, and my really simple app works, which is the important part.
