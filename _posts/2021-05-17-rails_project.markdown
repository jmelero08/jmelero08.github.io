When I finally got to my rails project it took me a while to figure out what I wanted to build. After some thinking I though it would be a good idea to make an app where people can right car reviews. This was because I am currently in the market for a new car and was constanly on forums reading peoples opinions on their own cars. 

When I first started making out the outline for the models I had a hard time making sure that I was meeting one of the first requirments. Which was to have a join table along with a many-to-many relationship. After talking to Dustin, I figured it out and I was good to go. The rest of the app wasn't to hard to build and before you know it, I was done!
